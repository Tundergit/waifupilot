**waifupilot - a fun and sassy dashcam software that does other stuff too**

** Ram 1500 users: this fork and branch are untested, and incomplete.  Panda safety features are not being enforced.  There is inherent risk involved with any automotive pursuit.  This is no different.  Use common sense, use only when it's safe, and understand that you and only you are liable for any damages caused by your use of this software.  

And now, a word from comma.ai: 

Community Maintained Cars and Features are not verified by comma to meet our [safety model](SAFETY.md). Be extra cautious using them. They are only available after enabling the toggle in `Settings->Developer->Enable Community Features`.

To promote a car from community maintained, it must meet a few requirements. We must own one from the brand, we must sell the harness for it, has full ISO26262 in both panda and openpilot, there must be a path forward for longitudinal control, it must have AEB still enabled, and it must support fingerprinting 2.0

Installation Instructions
------

Install openpilot on an EON or comma two by entering ``https://openpilot.comma.ai`` during the installer setup.

Follow these [video instructions](https://youtu.be/lcjqxCymins) to properly mount the device on the windshield. Note: openpilot features an automatic pose calibration routine and openpilot performance should not be affected by small pitch and yaw misalignments caused by imprecise device mounting.

Before placing the device on your windshield, check the state and local laws and ordinances where you drive. Some state laws prohibit or restrict the placement of objects on the windshield of a motor vehicle.

You will be able to engage openpilot after reviewing the onboarding screens and finishing the calibration procedure.

Limitations of openpilot ALC and LDW
------

openpilot ALC and openpilot LDW do not automatically drive the vehicle or reduce the amount of attention that must be paid to operate your vehicle. The driver must always keep control of the steering wheel and be ready to correct the openpilot ALC action at all times.

While changing lanes, openpilot is not capable of looking next to you or checking your blind spot. Only nudge the wheel to initiate a lane change after you have confirmed it's safe to do so.

Many factors can impact the performance of openpilot ALC and openpilot LDW, causing them to be unable to function as intended. These include, but are not limited to:

* Poor visibility (heavy rain, snow, fog, etc.) or weather conditions that may interfere with sensor operation.
* The road facing camera is obstructed, covered or damaged by mud, ice, snow, etc.
* Obstruction caused by applying excessive paint or adhesive products (such as wraps, stickers, rubber coating, etc.) onto the vehicle.
* The device is mounted incorrectly.
* When in sharp curves, like on-off ramps, intersections etc...; openpilot is designed to be limited in the amount of steering torque it can produce.
* In the presence of restricted lanes or construction zones.
* When driving on highly banked roads or in presence of strong cross-wind.
* Extremely hot or cold temperatures.
* Bright light (due to oncoming headlights, direct sunlight, etc.).
* Driving on hills, narrow, or winding roads.

The list above does not represent an exhaustive list of situations that may interfere with proper operation of openpilot components. It is the driver's responsibility to be in control of the vehicle at all times.

Limitations of openpilot ACC and FCW
------

openpilot ACC and openpilot FCW are not systems that allow careless or inattentive driving. It is still necessary for the driver to pay close attention to the vehicle’s surroundings and to be ready to re-take control of the gas and the brake at all times.

Many factors can impact the performance of openpilot ACC and openpilot FCW, causing them to be unable to function as intended. These include, but are not limited to:

* Poor visibility (heavy rain, snow, fog, etc.) or weather conditions that may interfere with sensor operation.
* The road facing camera or radar are obstructed, covered, or damaged by mud, ice, snow, etc.
* Obstruction caused by applying excessive paint or adhesive products (such as wraps, stickers, rubber coating, etc.) onto the vehicle.
* The device is mounted incorrectly.
* Approaching a toll booth, a bridge or a large metal plate.
* When driving on roads with pedestrians, cyclists, etc...
* In presence of traffic signs or stop lights, which are not detected by openpilot at this time.
* When the posted speed limit is below the user selected set speed. openpilot does not detect speed limits at this time.
* In presence of vehicles in the same lane that are not moving.
* When abrupt braking maneuvers are required. openpilot is designed to be limited in the amount of deceleration and acceleration that it can produce.
* When surrounding vehicles perform close cut-ins from neighbor lanes.
* Driving on hills, narrow, or winding roads.
* Extremely hot or cold temperatures.
* Bright light (due to oncoming headlights, direct sunlight, etc.).
* Interference from other equipment that generates radar waves.

The list above does not represent an exhaustive list of situations that may interfere with proper operation of openpilot components. It is the driver's responsibility to be in control of the vehicle at all times.

Limitations of openpilot DM
------

openpilot DM should not be considered an exact measurement of the alertness of the driver.

Many factors can impact the performance of openpilot DM, causing it to be unable to function as intended. These include, but are not limited to:

* Low light conditions, such as driving at night or in dark tunnels.
* Bright light (due to oncoming headlights, direct sunlight, etc.).
* The driver's face is partially or completely outside field of view of the driver facing camera.
* The driver facing camera is obstructed, covered, or damaged.

The list above does not represent an exhaustive list of situations that may interfere with proper operation of openpilot components. A driver should not rely on openpilot DM to assess their level of attention.

User Data and comma Account
------

By default, openpilot uploads the driving data to our servers. You can also access your data by pairing with the comma connect app ([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/comma-connect/id1456551889), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ai.comma.connect&hl=en_US)). We use your data to train better models and improve openpilot for everyone.

openpilot is open source software: the user is free to disable data collection if they wish to do so.

openpilot logs the road facing camera, CAN, GPS, IMU, magnetometer, thermal sensors, crashes, and operating system logs.
The driver facing camera is only logged if you explicitly opt-in in settings. The microphone is not recorded.

By using openpilot, you agree to [our Privacy Policy](https://my.comma.ai/privacy). You understand that use of this software or its related services will generate certain types of user data, which may be logged and stored at the sole discretion of comma. By accepting this agreement, you grant an irrevocable, perpetual, worldwide right to comma for the use of this data.

Safety and Testing
----

* openpilot observes ISO26262 guidelines, see [SAFETY.md](SAFETY.md) for more details.
* openpilot has software in the loop [tests](.github/workflows/test.yaml) that run on every commit.
* The safety model code lives in panda and is written in C, see [code rigor](https://github.com/commaai/panda#code-rigor) for more details.
* panda has software in the loop [safety tests](https://github.com/commaai/panda/tree/master/tests/safety).
* Internally, we have a hardware in the loop Jenkins test suite that builds and unit tests the various processes.
* panda has additional hardware in the loop [tests](https://github.com/commaai/panda/blob/master/Jenkinsfile).
* We run the latest openpilot in a testing closet containing 10 EONs continuously replaying routes.

Testing on PC
------
For simplified development and experimentation, openpilot can be run in the CARLA driving simulator, which allows you to develop openpilot without a car. The whole setup should only take a few minutes.

Steps:
1) Start the CARLA server on first terminal
```
bash -c "$(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/commaai/openpilot/master/tools/sim/start_carla.sh)"
```
2) Start openpilot on second terminal
```
bash -c "$(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/commaai/openpilot/master/tools/sim/start_openpilot_docker.sh)"
```
3) Press 1 to engage openpilot

See the full [README](tools/sim/README.md)

You should also take a look at the tools directory in master: lots of tools you can use to replay driving data, test, and develop openpilot from your PC.


Community and Contributing
------

openpilot is developed by [comma](https://comma.ai/) and by users like you. We welcome both pull requests and issues on [GitHub](http://github.com/commaai/openpilot). Bug fixes and new car ports are encouraged.

You can add support for your car by following guides we have written for [Brand](https://medium.com/@comma_ai/how-to-write-a-car-port-for-openpilot-7ce0785eda84) and [Model](https://medium.com/@comma_ai/openpilot-port-guide-for-toyota-models-e5467f4b5fe6) ports. Generally, a car with adaptive cruise control and lane keep assist is a good candidate. [Join our Discord](https://discord.comma.ai) to discuss car ports: most car makes have a dedicated channel.
